# Dynamic Diagram Flow

## Project Overview
This project utilizes React Flow to create interactive diagram flows based on dynamic metadata. The diagram is rendered dynamically based on nodes and edges defined in a JSON schema.

## Requirements
- React Flow library for rendering the diagram.
- Functionality to dynamically add, remove, and edit nodes and edges.
- Sidebar for inputting metadata for nodes and edges.
- Responsive design to handle various screen sizes.
- State management using React Context.
